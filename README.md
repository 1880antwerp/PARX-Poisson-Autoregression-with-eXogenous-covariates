# PARX-Poisson Autoregression with Exogenous Covariates

This is an implementation in R of the PARX model for football matches predictions, based on the research paper: [PARX Model for Football Matches Predictions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308416031_PARX_model_for_football_matches_predictions).

## Overview
The project implements the PARX (Poisson Autoregression with Exogenous covariates) model for predicting the outcomes of football matches. This statistical model focuses on utilizing both team-specific attributes and external factors to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Key Variables
- `home_team` (String): Name of the home team.
- `away_team` (String): Name of the away team.
- `homeGoalCount` (Integer): Number of goals scored by the home team.
- `awayGoalCount` (Integer): Number of goals scored by the away team.

## Usage
The script is written in R and can be run in any standard R environment.
